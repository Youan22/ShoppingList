# Overview

Very few people in general and usually few students know how to control their buying behavior. As students, they frequently visit the store without a prdetermine list of items they wish to purchase.
As a result, their finances are harmed by this practice unfortunatelly. They end up buying stuffs they never intended to.

The Java program I planned to create is a simple shopping list maker and it will store a list of items and their respective quantities, amounts, by making use of an ArrayList class. The program will enabe
the user to edit the list by adding, deleting, and displaying products, viewing item's total cost and computing the total amount to be spent. Interestingly, the program will have the capacity to limit expenses
to a fixed amount.

I planned creating a Java software that stores and manages a list of strings (items) for a shopping list using arrays list. The program will set a maximum spending amount and keep track of items. 
It will attempts to assist consumers ot it users in creating a formal shopping list to help save money and be in charge or control of buying habit.  

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
